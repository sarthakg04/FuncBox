We at FuncBox bring a small box full of creative app cards which will help your kid learn to code, build creative apps, type these codes themselves and also share the same with peers. We also provide a really interactive code editor where your kid will be guided to develop code and all at the ease of handhold.

We believe that this is not the era of boring video lectures but the era of building it yourself and learning because we believe in experimenting, creative thinking and Resilience, and the ability of your child to have confidence in him.
